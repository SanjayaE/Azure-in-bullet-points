# Manage Azure subscriptions and resources

- **Using Azure Cloud Shell**
  - In background it uses dockerized version of powershell.
  - When you open it for the first time, it creates a new storage account called `azcloudshell` and some numbers
    - It then creates a file share that stores your user information.

## Manage resource groups

- **Resource groups**
  - Logical grouping of resources that shares the same lifecycles.
    - Resource group holds different unique resources.
    - Resource groups can contain resources that reside in different regions.
      - Location of resource group is just the meta data for the resource group.
  - Resource groups can have
    - ***Tags***: categorization / organization of resource groups for e.g. billing, management
      - E.g. `Dept: IT`
      - üí° Tags are not inherited
      - ‚ùó Max 15 tag name/value pairs.
    - ***Locks***: For accidental deletion or accidental changes to resources within a resource group.
      - Consists of two locks:
        - `CanNotDelete`
          - Authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.
        - `ReadOnly`
          - Authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource.
          - Same as giving everyone a ***Reader*** role.
      - Locks are inherited from resources within the resource group.
    - ***IAM***: Access control, RBAC
      - Roles are iherited
      - ***Role assignment***: Role defination role (role, e.g. Reader) + Person/Scope/Service Principal + Scope
    - ***Policies***: Azure entity that controls behaviors within a resource group
      - Allow you to keep compliant with corparate standards and SLAs.
      - Set in a ***scope*** with a ***name*** and ***definition***.
        - Scope: E.g. resource group, subscription.
        - Definition: E.g. *"Allow resource types"*
          - Name, description, Policy (e.g. `azurepolicy.rules.json`), Parameters (e.g. `azurepolicy.parameters.json`)
    - ***Events***: Create event subscriptions triggered by the resources group in Event Grid.
    - ***Automation script***
      - Can be added to library to be redeployed later on.
        - ‚ùó All resources cannot be redeployed
        - üí° Must change the name to avoid duplicates.
      - ARM templates for resource groups can also be found on github.
      - You can *Add to library*, or click on *Deploy* to deploy directly.
  - ***Moving resources***
    - You can move resources to another resource group or subscription.
      - ‚ùó All resources cannot be moved.
      - `az resource move --destination-group new-rg --id resourceid`
      - In portal Overview -> Move
  - ***Alerts***
    1. **Target**: What resource and where
    2. **Criteria**: What specific action
    3. **Details**: Who, when, where, how
    4. **Action Group**: Who to inform and how to inform them
        - **Action Type**: Email/SMS/Push/Voice, Azure Funtion, LogicApp, Webhook, ITSM, Automation Runbook
  - **Metrics**
    1. **Resource group**: Where to look at the metric
    2. **Resource type**: The type of resource to look at
    3. **Available metrics**: What specifics about the metrics
    4. **Chart**: Graphic display of the metric

## Manage Azure subscriptions

- **Resource tagging**
  - Tags are additional metadata that can be assigned to resources/resource groups.
    - ‚ùó Child resources do not inherit resource groups tags
    - ‚ùó Max 15 tag name/value pairs.
  - E.g. `CostCenter = YHZ`
  - Why?
    - Organize
    - Search
    - View
    - Billing & cost managements
  - On Portal
    - You can search for Tags and see filtered lists.
    - ‚ùó Resources are tagged **after** resource is created as opposed to PowerShell/CLI.

- **Microsoft Azure Policies**
  - Configures what kind of resources can be deployed and managed
  - Ensures proper cloud governance by controlling resource deployment and usage.
  - ‚ùó Publishing requires `Microsoft.Authorization/policyassigments/write` permission.
  - The assigner is saved as `assignedBy` property.
  - Apply to new and existing resources.
    - Resources are scanned hourly for compliance with policies.
  - **Built-in policies**
    - E.g.: Require SQL Server 12.0, Allowed Storage Account SKU, Allowed Resource Types, Allowed Locations, Allowed Virtual Machine SKUs, Apply tag and its default value, Enforce tag and its value, Not allowed resource types
  - **Custom Policies**
    - JSON format
      - Supports logical operations (`or`, `allOf`, `noneOf`) and `if` statements.
    - Used for granular resource control
      - E.g. limit load balancer creation to IT admins.
    - Can be create manually or by copying existing policy from e.g. GitHub.
    - E.g.

      ```js
      {
        "policyRule": {
          "if": {
            "not": {
              "field": "location",
              "in": "[parameters('allowedLocations')]"
            }
          },
          "then": {
            "effect": "audit"
          },

            "allowedLocations": {
              "type": "Array",
              "metadata": {
                "description": "The list of allowed locations for resources",
                "displayName": "Allowed Locations",
                "strongType": "location"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

  - **Policy parameters**
    - Passed to policy
    - Enable policy reuse
      - Fewer policies are required.
    - String or array
  - **Policy Effects**
    - ***Append***: Resource policy additions, e.g. tags.

    - ***AuditIfNotExists***: Enables audit if resource does not exists
    - ***Deny***: Denies deployment
      - üí° Existing non-compliant resources are marked but not deleted.
    - ***DeployIfNotExists***: If resource does not exists, deploy it.
  - **Management Groups**
    - Organizes multiple subscriptions.
    - Up to 6 hierarchical levels.
    - Allows to assign policy groups
      - üí° Subscriptions inherit settings
    - Facilitates RBAC
    - Subscriptions can be moved to other parts of hierarchy.
  - **Exclusion scopes**
    - Policies can have exclusions
      - E.g. resource groups in subscription, or VM's in resource groups.
  - **Policy Initiative Definations**
    - Groups policies into a single unit.
    - Used when a single Azure governance goal consists of multiple checks.
    - Can be assigned to resources/groups/subscriptions

![How classic subscription administrator roles, Azure RBAC roles, and Azure AD administrator roles are related](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/media/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles/rbac-admin-roles.png)
- **Classic Administrator Roles**
  - The account that is used to sign up for Azure is automatically set as both the *Account Administrator* and *Service Administrator*.
    - Roles are properties that can be changed in Subcription blade
  - üí° Azure recommends using RBAC roles
  - **Account Administrator** (1 per Azure account)
    - Conceptually, the billing owner of the subscription.
    - Cancle, Manage and Create new subscriptions
    - Change the billing for a subscription
    - Change the Service Administrator
    - The Account Administrator has no access to the Azure portal.
  - **Service Administrator** (1 per Azure subscription)
    - By default, for a new subscription, the Account Administrator is also the Service Administrator.
    - The Service Administrator has the equivalent access of a user who is assigned the Owner (Azure RBAC) role at the subscription scope.
    - The Service Administrator has full access to the Azure portal.
    - Cancel the subscription
    - Assign users to the Co-Administrator role
  - **Co-Administrator** (200 per subscription)
    - The Co-Administrator has the equivalent access of a user who is assigned the Owner  (Azure RBAC) role at the subscription scope.
    - Same access privileges as the Service Administrator
    - can‚Äôt change the association of subscriptions to Azure directories
    - Assign users to the Co-Administrator role, but cannot change the Service Administrator

- **Microsoft Azure Resource Providers**
  - Enables Azure features.
  - Many are registered automatically
    - E.g. `Microsoft.Compute` that handles VM's, `Microsoft.Network`, `Microsoft.Sql`, `Microsoft.Storage`
  - Some are not registered automatically
    - E.g. `Microsoft.PolicyInsights`, `Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory`, `Microsoft.AzureStack`, `Microsoft.Botservice`
    - Custom providers can be registered with subscription.
      - Requires the `Contributor` or `Owner` roles.
      - In most cases providers are registered automatically when you deploy resources that uses the providers.
  - You can register, unregister, re-register through Subscription -> Resource providers in Portal
